Additionally, in the folder [evaluation_pangenie](evaluation_pangenie/) there is a pipeline showing how to use the tool PanGenie in order to genotype for varaints of a sample using short-read data as well as to measure the performance of the resulting genotyped data and a benchmark assembly of such sample.
